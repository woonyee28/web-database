284,512,,RLD1,13,,,,Human,,,,RANKL,8600,Bone,Bone,Osteoblast,Unknown,Luciferase reporter assay,"The similarity in functional activity between the mouse and human RLD5 regions (24) together with the high degree of conservation noted at mouse RLD1–RLD4 prompted us to examine these other segments of DNA from the human gene for their capacity to mediate transcriptional activation by 1,25-(OH)2D3. We therefore amplified DNA fragments that corresponded to human RLD1–RLD4, cloned them into a thymidine kinase (TK) promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, and assessed their transcriptional activity in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 after introduction into human osteoblastic MG63 cells. The positions and individual characteristics of these fragments are documented in Fig. 2, A and B. Figure 2C depicts the results of this experiment, which demonstrate that whereas hRLD5a was capable of mediating a modest response to 1,25(OH)2D3 (see inset), as observed in our earlier studies, hRLD2 (see inset) and especially hRLD1 were strikingly sensitive to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Thus, a 2- to 5-fold induction was observed when the hRLD2 or hRLD5 regions were examined, and an over 20-fold induction was obtained when hRLD1 was present. Neither hRLD3 nor hRLD4 were able to confer any degree of sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3, an observation consistent with that seen in the mouse RLD3 and RLD4 enhancer regions. These findings demonstrate that the five conserved regions in the human gene that correspond to mouse RLD1–RLD5 display both similarities as well as differences in their ability to mediate a transcriptional response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in MG63 cells. They also suggest the possibility that the regulatory region at RLD1 in the human gene may play a dominant role in human RANKL gene regulation.",2-3,"An Enhancer 20 Kilobases Upstream of the Human Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand Gene Mediates Dominant Activation by 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3","Nerenz, Robert D.",2008,Molecular Endocrinology,22:1044-1056,10.1210/me.2007-0380,18202151,yeexuan,"According to the paper, position of enhancer only available upon request."
